This project is about building a Music Management System application using the Spring Boot framework. The application is designed to handle and manipulate large amounts of data, specifically a publicly available “Spotify tracks” dataset.

The application provides authentication functionality, allowing users to access and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the dataset. The project report covers the code implementation (including HTML, CSS, and Java components), the source datasets, the objective of the data storage framework, possible database solutions, the architecture of the data storage, and the challenges faced during development.

Each member of the group was responsible for a specific part of the project, and the report includes a detailed description and rationalization of all the functionalities of the Spring Application, as well as each group member’s reflection and contribution. The goal of the project is to create a safe, fast, modern, and manageable web application that can simplify lives and allow progress to move forward.
